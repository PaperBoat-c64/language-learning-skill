# Prompt — Extract Expressions

Used in Step 6. Produces expression records per `references/idioms-and-slang.md`.

## When to use

After vocabulary selection, or on request ("what idioms are in here?").

## Required inputs

- Segmented source with translations
- `{{TEXT_LANGUAGE}}` and language rules
- Optional: learner level, existing vocabulary records (to avoid duplication)

## Prompt

```text
You are extracting fixed expressions from a {{TEXT_LANGUAGE}} text for a learner.

Explanation language: {{EXPLANATION_LANGUAGE}}
Already-glossed vocabulary (do not duplicate): {{VOCAB_IDS_OR_TERMS}}

Text:
"""
{{SEGMENTED_SOURCE}}
"""

Apply the taxonomy and tests in references/idioms-and-slang.md:
collocation | phrasal-verb | idiom | colloquialism | slang | valency | grammatical-expression

For each candidate, run the decision procedure and record which test it passed.
Include an item only if at least one holds:
- non-compositional meaning a learner would misread;
- a collocation strong enough that a synonym sounds foreign;
- register or region that would cause a social error;
- a valency pattern needed for correct production.

Do NOT include:
- ordinary syntax or transparent compounds;
- one-off poetic images;
- items that duplicate a vocabulary record;
- items added to reach a count.

For each expression, output:
- id: e001 (reading order)
- text: verbatim span, same inflection as the source
- type: one of the taxonomy values
- literalMeaning: required for idioms/slang where it differs; else optional
- meaningInContext: functional meaning in {{EXPLANATION_LANGUAGE}}
- register: formal | neutral | informal | colloquial | vulgar | literary | archaic | mixed
- region: [] unless evidenced; regionCertainty: verified | probable | unverified
- sensitivity: none | mild | offensive | slur
- usageNotes: constraints, who may use it, regional caveats
- examples: 1–2 original sentences + translation
- alternatives: equivalent or similar expressions
- priority: high | medium | low
- confidence: high | medium | low
- needsVerification: true iff regional/slang/disputed
- sentenceRefs: existing IDs

If nothing qualifies, say exactly:
"本段未发现需要单独讲解的高价值固定表达或俚语。" and give one sentence explaining why.
Do not fabricate items to fill the section.

Never claim an expression is "used everywhere", "very common", or "universal" without evidence.
```

## Output contract

Expression records + a one-line extraction verdict. Counts proportionate to text length (roughly 2–8 for a 5–10 sentence text).

## Self-check

- [ ] Every `text` occurs verbatim in the source.
- [ ] Type passes the taxonomy tests.
- [ ] Idioms/slang have literal vs. contextual meaning separated.
- [ ] Every item has a register.
- [ ] Regional claims have evidence or are marked unverified.
- [ ] Sensitivity set for vulgar/offensive items.
- [ ] No duplicates with vocabulary records.
- [ ] Empty section stated explicitly, not padded.
